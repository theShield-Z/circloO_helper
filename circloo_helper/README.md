The primary part of circloO Helper, this folder contains a WIP library to simplify creating levels via code.

Not a lot is finished at the moment, but it's fully usable. Message me if there are any bugs.

## Features

- Explicit object definitions (so you don't have to memorize the syntax of each object!)
- Creation and editing of levels and objects
- Ability to save coded levels to a file

## To Do

- more tools
- organization
- documentation
