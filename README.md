This is a work-in-progress repository of programs to make it easier for circloO level creators to create levels.

Example codes for how to use each program are in each program's primary file (usually in `main.py`)


## Current Programs

### circloO Helper
Build levels in Python. Install it from the circloO_helper_library branch.

### Image converter
Convert image files (most common types supported) into circloO objects that can be copy-pasted into a level file.

### Video converter
Convert video files (most common types supported) into a circloO level file.

### Pixel Builder
Convert a 2D binary array into a display of circloO objects that can be copy-pasted into a level file.

### Text converter
Convert strings of characters or words into circloO objects that can be copy-pasted into a level file.
